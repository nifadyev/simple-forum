Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case your forgot your Django Boards username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the link below does't work. please copy and paste URL in a new browser window instead.

if you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address
by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to 
take any futher action and can safely disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Boards Team
